Note:

- src/main contains the java files for quick reference
- inherit from "BaseTransaction" to build transactions, remember to overwrite "execute" abstract function
- included datatype for New Order Transaction output printing (could be converted to reference)
- 2 text files included "testNewOrderTransaction.txt" and "testPaymentTransaction.txt"; feed the right text file to test the corresponding transaction
